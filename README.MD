## About
A [Discord](https://discord.com/) bot I made for generating brave (random) [League of Legends](https://leagueoflegends.com/) builds directly to your Discord server.  

Inspired by: [Ultimate Bravery](https://ultimate-bravery.net/)

## Permissions
This bot requires the following permissions.  Denial of these permissions will result the bot not being able to send generated builds:
- Read message history
- Send messages
- Send embeded links
- Send files

## Commands
This bot uses the `~` prefix.  Bellow are the commands:

`~brave` - Gives you a brave build.

`~info` - Gives bot info, rules, current LoL patch, and link to this repo.

`~help` - Displays available commands, and their description

## Build notes
You are guaranteed to draw one (1) mythic item, and -unless you draw Cassiopea, one (1) Advanced Boot item.

You are guaranteed a valid build.  Example of invalid builds:
- Runaans's Huricane + any melee champion
- Maw of Malmoritus + Sterak's Gage in the same build
- Infinity Edge + Guinsoo's Rageblade in the same build

If you get an illegal build, please open an [issue](https://github.com/CosmanAgraz/shyvana-bot/issues)
